Novice-level speakers can communicate short messages on highly predictable, everyday topics that affect them directly. They do so primarily through the use of isolated words and phrases that have been encountered, memorized, and recalled. Novice-level speakers may be difficult to understand even by the most sympathetic interlocutors accustomed to non-native speech. Speakers at the Novice High sublevel are capable of handling various tasks related to the Intermediate level but cannot consistently maintain performance at that level. They can successfully manage several uncomplicated communicative tasks in straightforward social situations. Conversations are limited to predictable topics essential for survival in the target language culture, such as basic personal information, objects, a limited number of activities, preferences, and immediate needs. Novice High speakers respond to simple, direct questions or requests for information and can ask a few formulaic questions.  Expressing personal meaning, Novice High speakers heavily rely on learned phrases or combinations of these and what they hear from their interlocutors. Their language primarily consists of short and sometimes incomplete sentences in the present, which may be hesitant or inaccurate. However, as their language often comprises expansions of learned material and stock phrases, they may occasionally sound surprisingly fluent and accurate. Pronunciation, vocabulary, and syntax may be strongly influenced by the first language. Although frequent misunderstandings may arise, with repetition or rephrasing, Novice High speakers can generally be understood by sympathetic interlocutors accustomed to non-natives.  When called upon to handle a variety of topics and perform functions related to the Intermediate level, a Novice High speaker can sometimes respond in intelligible sentences but will not be able to sustain sentence-level discourse.
