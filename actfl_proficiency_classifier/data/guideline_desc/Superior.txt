Speakers at the Superior level can communicate with accuracy and fluency to fully and effectively participate in conversations across a variety of topics in both formal and informal settings, encompassing concrete and abstract perspectives. They adeptly discuss their interests and specialized fields, elaborate on complex matters, and deliver extensive and coherent narrations effortlessly, maintaining ease, fluency, and accuracy. These speakers express their opinions on various issues, including social and political matters, and construct well-organized arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. They can formulate and explore hypotheses to investigate alternative possibilities.  When appropriate, Superior-level speakers engage in extended discourse without unnaturally lengthy hesitation to convey their points, even in abstract elaborations. While maintaining coherence, their discourse may still reflect language patterns beyond those of the target language. Superior-level speakers employ diverse interactive and discourse strategies, including turn-taking and the separation of main ideas from supporting information through the use of syntactic, lexical, and phonetic devices.  At the Superior level, speakers exhibit no consistent pattern of errors in basic structures, although sporadic errors may arise, particularly in low-frequency structures and complex high-frequency structures. If errors occur, they do not distract the native interlocutor or hinder communication.
