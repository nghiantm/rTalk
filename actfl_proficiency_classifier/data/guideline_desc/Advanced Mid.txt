Speakers at the Advanced level engage in conversation in a clearly participatory manner to communicate information on autobiographical topics, as well as topics of community, national, or international interest. The topics are handled concretely through narration and description in the major time frames of past, present, and future. These speakers can also deal with a social situation with an unexpected complication. The language of Advanced-level speakers is abundant, with the oral paragraph being the measure of Advanced-level length and discourse. Advanced-level speakers have sufficient control of basic structures and generic vocabulary to be understood by native speakers of the language, including those unaccustomed to non-native speech. Speakers at the Advanced Mid sublevel can confidently handle a wide range of communicative tasks. They actively participate in both informal and some formal exchanges, covering diverse topics such as work, school, home, leisure activities, as well as current events and personal interests. Advanced Mid speakers exhibit proficiency in narrating and describing across past, present, and future time frames, providing comprehensive accounts with good control of aspect. Narration and description are seamlessly combined in paragraph-length discourse to convey relevant facts.  These speakers adeptly navigate linguistic challenges presented by complications or unexpected events within routine situations. They demonstrate familiarity with communicative tasks and often employ strategies like circumlocution or rephrasing. Advanced Mid speakers performing at this level exhibit a substantial flow in their speech. While their vocabulary is generally extensive, it tends to be primarily generic, unless discussing a particular area of specialization or interest. Their discourse may still reflect the oral paragraph structure of their native language rather than that of the target language.  Contributing to conversations on familiar topics with accuracy, clarity, and precision, Advanced Mid speakers convey their intended message without misrepresentation or confusion. They are easily understood by native speakers unaccustomed to dealing with non-natives. However, when tasked with functions or topics associated with the Superior level, the quality and/or quantity of their speech may generally decline.
