Novice-level speakers can communicate short messages on highly predictable, everyday topics that affect them directly. They do so primarily through the use of isolated words and phrases that have been encountered, memorized, and recalled. Novice-level speakers may be difficult to understand even by the most sympathetic interlocutors accustomed to non-native speech. Speakers at the Novice Low sublevel have no real functional ability and, due to their pronunciation, may be unintelligible. Given adequate time and familiar cues, they may be able to exchange greetings, give their identity, and name a number of familiar objects from their immediate environment. However, they are unable to perform functions or handle topics pertaining to the Intermediate level and cannot, therefore, participate in a true conversational exchange.
